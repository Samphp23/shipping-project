🔑 Notes
- Version pinning: I’ve pinned stable versions as of late 2025 so your builds are reproducible.
- Updates: If you want flexibility, you can drop the ==version pins, but for CI/CD pipelines it’s best to pin.
- Placement: Store this file at the root of your repo (next to azure-pipelines.yml).
- Pipeline step: In your YAML, replace the install block with:
- script: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  displayName: Install Dependencies



This way, every time you push code changes to GitHub, Azure DevOps will automatically pick up the latest script and dependencies from requirements.txt.
👉 Do you want me to also show you how to reference this requirements.txt in your Azure ML Environment so both DevOps and ML pipelines stay perfectly aligned?
